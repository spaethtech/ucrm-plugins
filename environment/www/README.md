> _This folder is excluded from source control by default and should remain that way._

Maps to `/home/vagrant/src/` inside the Vagrant machine, which is mounted to `/usr/src/ucrm/web/_plugins` inside the
UCRM docker container.

The folder and it's files are generated by the UCRM system during installation of a Plugin and are only here for path 
mapping. This allows us to see (and step through) the entire stack trace when debugging using the included Xdebug setup.

This folder will be empty after installation of the Vagrant system, but will update (via the SMB share) as Plugins added
or removed in the UCRM system.
